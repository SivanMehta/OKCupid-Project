# Requirements

*  Your group must create a Shiny application, hosted on the Statistics Department web servers, to visualize the OK Cupid data.
*  Your group's focus should be on a well-defined subgroup of the OK Cupid dataset.  For example, you might focus on users who's profiles list them as having "athletic" body types; as never using drugs; as being social drinkers; as having income over $100,000; as being over 6 feet tall; as men, women, etc; as straight, homosexual, etc; as being single, available, seeing someone, etc; etc.
*  Your goal is to analyze, visualize, and describe your subgroup as best as possible.  In doing so, it will likely be valuable to also analyze, visualize, and describe individuals NOT in your subgroup (for comparison purposes).  
*  Your group should create 8 graphics (10 if you have 5 group members).  
*  At least 4 of the graphics (5 if you have 5 group members) should be interactive in some way.  For example, you could allow the user to specify which variables to include on the x- or y-axis; which variables to color by; which variables to use in faceting; etc.
*  At least 6 of your graphics (7 if you have 5 group members) should contain two or more variables.
*  You are **strongly encouraged** to try new graphics that we didn't cover in class!
