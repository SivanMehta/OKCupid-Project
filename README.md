# Requirements

In order to start our application you will need the download [this file](https://github.com/rudeboybert/JSE_OkCupid/blob/master/profiles.csv.zip?raw=true) and unzip it as `profiles.csv`, then we can preprocess it correctly and start the app correctly

The directions for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/sventura/36-315_Spring_2016/blob/master/Final%20Project/Final%20Project.Rmd)
