# Requirements

In order to start our application you will need the download [this file](https://github.com/rudeboybert/JSE_OkCupid/blob/master/profiles.csv.zip?raw=true) and unzip it as `profiles.csv`, then we can preprocess it correctly and start the app correctly.

I recommend running `preprocess.r` *before* starting the application for the first time. If you don't, it will run automatically, but will delay the start up of the application. You can find the full server log of a successful run [here](https://github.com/SivanMehta/OKCupid-Project/wiki)

# Other

The directions for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/sventura/36-315_Spring_2016/blob/master/Final%20Project/Final%20Project.Rmd)

The Github pages version of the repo found [here](https://sivanmehta.github.io/OKCupid-Project/) is simply the rendered version of [`report.rmd`](https://github.com/SivanMehta/OKCupid-Project/blob/gh-pages/report.rmd), which includes fancy Rmarkdown formatting and some cool graphs.
